# Hamiltonian simulation function template

The [Hamiltonian simulation function template](https://qiskit.github.io/documentation/guides/serverless-template-hamiltonian-simulation)
grew out of notebooks which are included in this directory.

It performs Hamiltonian simulation
using the [AQC-Tensor](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-aqc-tensor)
Qiskit addon.

### Guide to files

`hamsim_template0.ipynb`: The original Hamiltonian simulation notebook, before it was adapted to be a Function.
`hamsim_template.ipynb`: A polyglot notebook which can either be run on a user's machine or executed as a Function.
`serverless_demo.ipynb`: A notebook which converts `hamsim_template.ipynb` to a Python program and runs it in Qiskit serverless.
`hamsim_template.pregenerated.py`: The Python program generated by the above notebook.
`hw_results_aqc.pkl`: Hardware results on `ibm_fez` with AQC enabled
`hw_results_comparison.pkl`: Hardware results on `ibm_fez` of equivalent circuit, without AQC.
`requirements.txt`: Dependencies.
`test_hamsim_template.py`: Automated tests of notebook.
